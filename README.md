### Haptic Research Team

### Project description
The project will make a haptic reality platform with an ultrasonic emitter array (at least 8 by 8, and ideally 16 * 16) that simulates the sense of touch and can be used for a range of applications such as enhanced gestures, producing tactile effects, like virtual lines and shapes, working with textures, as well as 3D models and controls.
The ultrasonic emitter array will be created using a printed circuit board (PCB), with one side having the ultrasonic emitters, and the other having the mounted field programmable gate array (FPGA) that controls the signals of the emitters, shift registers, drivers, and coupling capacitors. The algorithm for the emitter array will control each individual emitter so that they get triggered at different times so that all the waves coincide, the focal point.
